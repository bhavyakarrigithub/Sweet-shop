# Sweet-shop

I have created the static webpage for a sweet shop . 
In this website anyone can check the price and photos of the sweets availaable online, and also buy them. 
This project is made using Html, css , javascript.
Azure services used are AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS, AZURE STATIC WEB APP.
I used azure static web app to host my website and storage accounts for storing the source code.
